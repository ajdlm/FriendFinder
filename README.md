# Friend Finder

An app for finding new friends.

Users take a survey, and then Friend Finder searches its database for the person with the most similar answers. This match is then displayed to the user.

Note: All that is ultimately displayed is a picture and a name. Furthermore, the array containing possible matches has been pre-populated with dummy data.

## How to Use This App

* From the app's home page, click on the Go to Survey button.

* This will take you to the page with the survey on it. Fill out the input fields and select an answer from each of the drop-down menus.

* If you fail to either fill out both of the input fields or select answers from ALL of the drop-down menus, the page will not allow you to submit your survey.

* Once you have submitted your survey, a pop-up will appear with the name and picture of your best possible match.

* Your data will also be added to the array containing possible matches so that afterwards, if the survey is submitted again under a different name, the data you just entered will be a possible match.
